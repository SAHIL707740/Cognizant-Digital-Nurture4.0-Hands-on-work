Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation

Big O notation explains how the time or space needed by an algorithm grows with input size. O(1) is constant time, O(n) grows with input, and O(log n) means the input is halved each time.

In linear search, best case is when the item is at the start, average is in the middle, and worst is at the end or not found.

In binary search, best case is when the item is in the middle. Average and worst cases are faster than linear search as the search space keeps getting divided.

Step 4: Analysis

Linear search has O(n) time. It checks items one by one and works on unsorted data. Itâ€™s simple and fine for small lists.

Binary search has O(log n) time. It only works on sorted data but is faster for large lists.

Binary search is better if the data is sorted and searched often. Linear search is better for small or unsorted data.
